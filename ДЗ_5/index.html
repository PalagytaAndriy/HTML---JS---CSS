                    <h3>William Shakespeare</h3>
                </span>
                <hr>
                <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
                <p align="justify">William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 Ð¦ 23 April 1616) was
                    an English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the
                    greatest writer in the English language and the world's
                    greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national poet
                    and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including
                    collaborations, consist of approximately 39 plays, 154
                    sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses,
                    some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated
                    into every major living language and are performed more often
                    than those of any other playwright.</p>
                <p align="justify">Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon,
                    Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway,
                    with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet
                    and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a
                    successful career in London as an actor, writer, and
                    part-owner of a playing company called the Lord
                    Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age
                    49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford,
                    where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's
                    private life survive; this has stimulated considerable
                    speculation about such matters as his physical appearance,
                    his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works
                    attributed to him were written by others. Such theories
                    are often criticised for failing to adequately note that
                    few records survive of most commoners of the period.</p>
                <p align="justify">Shakespeare produced most of his known works between
                    1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies
                    and histories and are regarded as some of the best
                    work produced in these genres. Until about 1608, he
                    wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello,
                    King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among
                    the finest works in the English language. In the
                    last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies
                    (also known as romances) and collaborated with other
                    playwrights.</p>
                <p align="justify">Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions
                    of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime.
                    However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of
                    Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell,
                    published a more definitive text known as the First
                    Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's
                    dramatic works that included all but two of his plays.
                    The volume was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in
                    which Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare in a
                    now-famous quote as "not of an age, but for all time".</p>
                <p align="justify">Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works
                    have been continually adapted and rediscovered by new movements
                    in scholarship and performance. His plays remain popular and
                    are studied, performed, and reinterpreted through various
                    cultural and political contexts around the world.</p>
